I am going to build MAAS, Terraform, Ansible, and Openstack environment to do this:
provision every computer in the office to Ubuntu with remote desktop to a Windows virtual machine that is optimized for VBUSA. It has a robust backup system with Ceph and Azure. The only self-hosted tools so far is a password manager and Zammad.
